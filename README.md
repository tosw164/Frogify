# Pep and the Dying Forest

Pep and the Dying Forest is 2D story-driven platformer, that also comes under the banner of "Serious Games." A serious game is one in which the game is designed not purely for entertainment, but rather to enable the players to learn about certain ideas explored in the game.

Developed by Frogify Studios.

## Description

Our protagonist is Pep, a naive young frog that must persuade his tribe to leave and find a new home in the face of impending doom. Sadly, his rookie status prevents him from finding anyone that would listen, and those that do merely laughs at his ‘creativity’. Pep must gain respect from the three clans of the tribe: Clan Ethos, Clan Pathos, and Clan Logos. By learning from each clan’s trial, Pep learns the art of persuasion and argumentation, and is able to convince the tribe chief to the colony’s salvation.

## Running the Game

This Unity game was developed using Unity version 5.3.5f1. The game project should be importable after cloning the
repository and import the root directory as a project into Unity. Running the MainMenu scene (under Assets/Scenes)
will start the game. Alternatively, you can download the executable for the prototype under the
[releases](https://github.com/tosw164/Frogify/releases) section of the repository (you'll need to extract the zip
archive).

Please run the game/unity project from a local drive on the lab computers, as the network drives in UG4 gives file name
errors (when trying to import), and also because the game is being run over the network, there will be performance
issues (especially with frame rate).
